```

### Request Time Form Path (Netlify Managed)
```
User visits homepage
    ↓
Scrolls to "Book a Discovery Call"

Clicks "Request a Time" tab
    ↓
Fills form and submits
    ↓

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Webhook Returns 404
```
Cause: N8N workflow not active
Fix: Activate workflow in n8n dashboard
Status: Activate → Rerun diagnostics
```

### Form Submission Fails Silently
```
Cause: Check browser console
Fix: Open DevTools (F12) → Console → Look for errors
Debug: Run ./n8n-diagnostic.sh
```

### No Data in N8N
```
Cause: Webhook URL incorrect or workflow not listening
Fix: Verify webhook URL matches main.js
Status: Check N8N execution logs
```

### Netlify Not Sending Notifications
```
Cause: Notification not configured in Netlify
Fix: See N8N_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md step 2c
Status: Add HTTP POST notification → Test form
```
